# ðŸš¦ Detection of Street Signs

This project involves developing a street sign detection system using both **YOLO Neural Networks** and **Classical Image Processing** techniques. The goal is to enable real-time, robust detection of street signs to support applications such as **autonomous vehicles**, **traffic monitoring systems**, and **smart city infrastructure**.

---

## Project Overview

- **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once):** For fast, real-time object detection.
- **Classical Image Processing:** For sign detection using OpenCV-based methods.
- **Application:** Enhances traffic safety by detecting and classifying street signs from visual input.

---

## Tasks Performed

- **Preprocessing:** Enhanced image quality for better detection.
- **Feature Extraction:** Detected and classified various street signs.
- **Real-time Inference:** Performed live detection using trained YOLOv8 model.
