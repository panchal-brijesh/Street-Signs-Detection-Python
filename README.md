## Introduction

This project involves developing a street sign detection system using both **YOLO Neural Networks** and **Classical Image Processing** techniques. The goal is to enable real-time, robust detection of street signs to support applications such as **autonomous vehicles**, **traffic monitoring systems**, and **smart city infrastructure**.

## Project Overview

- **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once):** For fast, real-time object detection.
- **Classical Image Processing:** For sign detection using OpenCV-based methods.
- **Application:** Enhances traffic safety by detecting and classifying street signs from visual input.

---

## Tools

- **YOLOv8** â€“ Real-time object detection
- **OpenCV** â€“ Classical image processing
- **Google Colab** â€“ Training & inference
- **Python** â€“ Core programming language
- **Roboflow** â€“ Dataset preparation

## Dataset

- **Source:** Collected using [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/)
- **Annotations:** Labeled in YOLO format.
- **Classes:** Includes various types of street signs (e.g., Stop, Speed Limit, Yield).
- **Data Augmentation:** Rotation, scaling, flipping, and brightness adjustments were applied to improve robustness.

---

## Tasks Performed

- **Preprocessing:** Enhanced image quality for better detection.
- **Feature Extraction:** Detected and classified various street signs.
- **Real-time Inference:** Performed live detection using trained YOLOv8 model.

---

## Training Configuration

- **Optimizer:** SGD
- **Batch size:** 32
- **Learning rate:** 0.001
- **Epochs:** 20
- **Model:** YOLOv8

---

## Evaluation

- **Confusion Matrix:** Analyzed model accuracy and misclassifications.
- **Precision-Recall Curve:** Evaluated model performance across thresholds.

---

## Challenges & Solutions

- **Lighting and Angles:** Solved with data augmentation (brightness/rotation).
- **Occlusions:** Model trained on partially visible signs for robustness.
